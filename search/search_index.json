It started out ages ago as a modification of MalicVR\u2019s public profile , then looked less and less and less like that and I added and cleaned up a lot of things while removing the stuff I didn\u2019t use anyway. By now it would have probably been simpler to start from scratch. Funnily enough it has grown to rely way more on events provided by EDDI than actual voice commands. Chat Commands \u00b6 These commands will only work with the comms panel active, and you should be in the edit window ready to send. They will not hit Enter on their own. clear [chat;text] : Clears the chat window. Use from outside the comms panel. [local;squad;system;wing] chat : Puts you into the chosen chat channel. salute; oh seven : Will put \u201co7\u201d into the chat. Engineering/Materials \u00b6 how many [<g5 manufactured materials list>] do i have : Tells you how many of the given g5 manufactured material you currently have on board. I\u2019ve restricted it to just those to not spam speech recognition with too many phrases, and because those are the ones I usually want to know while jumping around the bubble and having an eye on any HGE that might be around. [launch;open] e d engineer : Opens the ED Engineer tool. what [mats;materials] do i need? : Runs the EDDI responder that tells you which materials are below wanted threshold. Needs setting those first. Gets very spammy if you do it for all of them; personally I only set them for g5 manufactured, so I can quickly check if it\u2019s worth looking for HGE in a system I\u2019m in. Navigation \u00b6 There are so many navigation-focused commands now, they deserve their own category. Basically anything that helps you plot anywhere. A lot of those are powered by awesome EDDI so I don\u2019t have to do the work myself! distance [from;to] [Sol;home;the center;Beagle Point;Colonia] : Gives you the current distance to the given POI. [find;target] nearest [encoded;manufactured;raw] material trader : Targets the nearest respective material trader. [find;target] nearest [fuel;scoopable] star : Targets the nearest scoopable star. [find;target] nearest [guardian;human] tech broker : Targets the nearest respective tech broker. [find;target] nearest [interstellar factor;mission system;scoopable star] : Well, you know the drill by now. [find;target] nearest mission system : Targets the nearest system that has a mission target. how many jumps left : Announces the jumps left on a neutron trip (requires SpanshAttack) or a course plotted via the galaxy map. plot course;[target;] next [waypoint;way point] : Plots a course to the text in your clipboard. target [bug killer;colonia;dav\u2019s hope;explorer\u2019s anchorage;jackson's lighthouse;jameson\u2019s cobra;robigo;shinrarta dezhra;sagittarius a*;shinrarta;sothis] : Targets the given system on the galaxy map. [where\u2019s;where is] my landing pad : Will tell you the location of your assigned landing pad on a starport. Ship Controls \u00b6 Basically anything that is related to directly doing something with your ship. [abort;cancel;stop] jumping : Stops a currently charging FSD jump. [half;] power to [engines;shields;systems;weapons] : Sets pips to 6/3/3 ( half ) or 8/2/2 towards the given capacitor. [balanced;half;] power to [engines;shields;systems;weapons] [and engines;and shields;and systems;and weapons;] : Sets pips to 6/6/0 (balanced), 5/5/2 (half) or 8/4/0 towards the given capacitors. [close;deploy;extend;open;retract;] [cargo scoop;hard points; landing gear] [up;down;] : Overly complicated command to handle everything related to Cargo Scoop, Hard Points, Landing Gear. You get the gist, I guess. Works in SRV too. [disco;discovery scan] : Executes a discovery scan. Expects the Discovery Scanner in your first fire group, secondary fire. You can change that . [dis;]engage silent running : Turns silent running on and off. [head;spot;] lights [on;off] : Turns your lights on and off. Works in SRV too, kinda; turning lights off there relies on the state updating fast enough, which sometimes leads to weird results. [jump;engage;get me out] [and scan;] [when ready;] : Retracts everything that might be protruding from your ship, then jumps to the next system. If the FSD isn\u2019t charging within 1s, it gets you into SC instead (e.g. if your target is obstructed). If given \u201cand scan\u201d runs a discovery scan. If given \u201cwhen ready\u201d waits for mass lock to clear, your FSD to cool down and you to leave scoop range before jumping. night vision [on;off] : Toggles your night vision on/off. Works in SRV too. rapid fire lights : Flashes your lights 5 times in a row. retract [all;everything] : Retracts, well, everything. [start;stop] [firing;mining] : Starts/stops holding down primary fire. Mostly useful when mining. When triggered with \u201cmining\u201d, also deploys the cargo scoop. [super;] cruise [when ready;] : Retracts everything, then jumps to SC. If given \u201cwhen ready\u201d will wait for mass lock to clear and your FSD to cool down first. SRV Controls \u00b6 Things relevant to your SRV, but not your ship. [recall;dismiss] ship : Recalls or dismisses ship. Currently does the same thing regardless of the state of your ship. I wish it would be possible to restrict it to doing one thing each, but that\u2019s currently not possible sadly. [toggle;enable;disable] drive assist : Handles all your drive assist needs! Targeting \u00b6 Well \u2026 targeting stuff, I guess. Not really sure why I made that its own category, but oh well :) target the [drive;drives;power plant;frame shift drive;f s d;shield generator] : Targets the given submodule on your current target, or your next target if you don\u2019t have one currently. Does not persist between targets. clear sub [module;system] target : Clears the current submodule target. target next system : Selects the next system on your route. target wing man [1;2;3] : Targets your wingmen. target\u2019s target : Targets your target\u2019s target (only works on wingmen). wing man [1;2;3] target : Targets your wingmen\u2019s target. wing man nav lock : Toggles wing man nav lock on the selected wing member. UI Commands \u00b6 Everything handling stuff that\u2019s not related to controlling your ship, but manipulating some UI element(s). [enter;leave] F S S : Opens/closes FSS. [main;game] menu : Opens the ESC menu. [relog;reset] to [open;solo] : Relogs to Open or Solo mode, respectively. controls options : Opens the controls options menu. docking request;request dock[ing;] : Sends a docking request. galaxy map : Opens the galaxy map. restart from Desktop : Quits the game and restarts from an open launcher by clicking the play button. set [default;star;station;settlement;signal sources;anomaly;unknown;system] filter : Sets a nav panel filter setting. See the command or just try different things for what is possible. You need to clear filters and hover over the filter button, then run this. system map : Opens the system map. take [high res;] screenshot : Takes a (high res) screenshot. toggle orbit lines : Toggles the visibility of orbit lines. Miscellaneous \u00b6 The commands in here do random more or less useful things. [are there any;] outdated stations [in this system;] : Runs an on-demand check for outdated stations in the current system. [bodies;what\u2019s;what is] left to [map;be mapped;scan] : Tells you which bodies EDDI thinks are worth mapping in the system that you haven\u2019t mapped yet. copy current system : Copies the current system name into the clipboard. open [current;] system on EDSM : Opens your current system on EDSM in your default browser. open copied system on EDSM : Opens the system in your clipboard on EDSM in your default browser. open coriolis : Opens Coriolis in your default browser. open e d d b [station;system;faction;] [search;] : Opens EDDB in your default browser. open e d s m : Opens EDSM in your default browser. open inara : Opens Inara in your default browser. open materials finder : Opens EDTutorials\u2019 materials finder in your default browser. open miner\u2019s tool : Opens https://edtools.cc/miner in your default browser. open spansh : Opens https://spansh.uk in your default browser. Events \u00b6 This is a list of ingame Events, provided by EDDI , that the profile will act on. AFMU Repairs \u00b6 Reports on the module that has been repaired, and if it has been fully or partially repaired. Body Mapped \u00b6 Announces an estimate for high-value bodies\u2019 payouts and the remaining mapping candidates in the system as given by EDDI. Body scanned \u00b6 Announces any interesting body traits found when scanning: terraformable Earth-like World, Ammonia World or Water World landable and >5\u202fg semimajor axis <1.5\u202fls (only really interesting for planets, but there\u2019s no proper way to separate them from moons, sadly) radius <300\u202fkm Feel free to suggest more! Carrier Cooldown \u00b6 Tells you when your carrier is able to do its next jump. Carrier Jump Engaged \u00b6 This event fires when your carrier jumps but you are not docked at it. It provides way less information than the Carrier Jumped event, but hey, I don\u2019t use most of it anyway. Basically just calls Carrier Jumped . Carrier Jump Request \u00b6 Announces the system and body your carrier has just been scheduled to jump to. Use this to double check ingame information; I\u2019ve had my carrier accept a body as jump target, but then end up around the star. This might give you a heads up on that. Also starts a command queue to give you advance warnings on carrier lockdown at -10, -5 and -2 minutes. Carrier Jumped \u00b6 Announces system and body your carrier has just jumped to. Carrier Pads Locked \u00b6 Announces your carrier\u2019s lockdown procedures. Discovery Scan \u00b6 Announces the number of bodies (and non-body signals) found in the system. Also compares the number of bodies to the amount reported by EDSM (requires Python scripts). Docked \u00b6 Automatically refuels, repairs, rearms, then gets your ship into the hangar and opens station services. Can be individually disabled. Docking Denied \u00b6 Tells you the reason for docking denial. Entered Normal Space \u00b6 Throttles to 0 upon dropping from SC, if the hyperspace dethrottle option is enabled. Fighter Launched \u00b6 Orders your ship to hold position so it doesn\u2019t chase after you immediately. Jet Cone Boost \u00b6 Sets your ship to full throttle immediately after you have supercharged. Jumped \u00b6 Zeroes throttle if the hyperspace dethrottle option is enabled. Gets the system\u2019s body count from EDSM if that option is enabled. Gets stations with outdated data (by default: older than 1 year) from Spansh\u2019s API. Again, if it is enabled. Starts a discovery scan if that is enabled. Last but not least tells you about planets worth scanning if you are on the R2R. Liftoff \u00b6 Retracts landing gear for you. Seriously, is there any occasion in which you don\u2019t immediately want to retract it after takeoff? Low Fuel \u00b6 Warns you when you reach 25% fuel. Also reports number of jumps you have left or the (rough) range you still have on the fumes left in your tank. Material Threshold \u00b6 Warns you when a monitored material falls below its minimum stock level and tells you when you reach your desired level or fill up. You will have to set minimum and desired amounts in EDDI\u2019s material monitor options first for all materials you wish to be monitored. Next Jump \u00b6 Gives you a jump count upon plotting a route using the galaxy map. Ship FSD \u00b6 This event actually is several different events in one. Currently the following are handled: Charging: Warns you if you are jumping with less than 25% fuel. Cooldown complete: Announces FSD cooldown if you are currently in normal space. Ship Interdicted \u00b6 Tells you when you have been interdicted by a player. Is also supposed to target the interdictor automatically, but randomly sometimes just doesn\u2019t work. Yay! SRV Launched \u00b6 Toggles SRV lights off after launching. Might not work if you drop particularly far after deployment because it works off a timer. Conversely might take a second to turn your lights off on a short drop and/or in high gravity. Synthesis \u00b6 Reports on the synthesis type and quality. System Scan Complete \u00b6 Lists all bodies EDDI considers worth mapping in the current system. Undocked \u00b6 Retracts landing gear for you. Seriously, is there any occasion in which you don\u2019t immediately want to retract it after takeoff?","title":"EliteAttack"},{"location":"EliteAttack/#eliteattack","text":"This is my personal VoiceAttack profile for Elite: Dangerous.

There are several commands you can run on this list, giving it a case number: Getting Case Information \u00b6 rat case number [0..30] details : Will give you all stored info on a case. [current;] rat case details : Will give you all stored info on the currently open case. distance to current rat case : Will give you the distance from your current location to the currently opened rat case. distance to rat case number [0..30] : Will give you the distance from your current system to a case\u2019s system. latest rat case details : Will give you the case data for the latest incoming case. nearest commander to rat case number [0..30] : Will give you the nearest of your CMDRs with their distance to a case\u2019s system. Requires some setup . nearest commander to [the;] rat case : Will give you the nearest of your CMDRs with their distance to the current case\u2019s system. Requires some setup . Opening a Case \u00b6 open rat case number [0..30] : Opens rat case with the given number. If there is no case data for that case (e.g. because you don\u2019t have your IRC client set up properly), it will still open it, just not have any data on it. open [latest;] rat case : Opens the latest rat case that has come in through IRC. Will only work if you actually have your IRC client setup to send case announcements to VoiceAttack . Opening a case will automatically copy the client\u2019s system to the clipboard for easy route plotting. This can be disabled. Making Calls \u00b6 There are a bunch of calls you can make for a case, the most common are modelled through VoiceAttack commands. The descriptive commands (e.g. \u201csystem confirmed\u201d) will be shortened to the usual IRC short hands (e.g. \u201csysconf\u201d). If you need something more unusual you can either still manually type it into your IRC client or use the \u201cGeneral IRC Integration\u201d, see below. call [1..20] jumps [and login;and takeoff;left;] : Calls jumps for the currently open case. You can optionally include that you will still have to login to the game or have to take off from your current station/port/outpost/planet. call jumps [left;] : Calls jumps for the currently open case based on a neutron trip (requires SpanshAttack) or a plotted ingame route. call friend [positive;negative] [in pg;in private group;in solo;in main menu;sysconf;system confirmed;] : Friend request confirmations, with all the things you might want to / should call with it. call [beacon;fuel;instance;pos;position;prep;sys;system;wing] [positive;negative] : All the stuff you usually need for ratting after you have received the friend request. call wing pending : Calls \u201cwr pending\u201d for when it takes 30s again to actually show up. call client in [exclusion zone;main menu;open;open sysconf;pg;private group;solo;super cruise] : Callouts for all the various things a client could get themselves into. call [client destroyed;client offline;sysconf;system confirmed] : This is the command you don\u2019t want to use. Include sysconf in your \u201cfriend+\u201d or \u201cin open\u201d calls, and make sure you will never have to call \u201cclient destroyed\u201d, would you? By default, VoiceAttack will ask for confirmation before sending calls to the #fuelrats channel. Closing a Case \u00b6 [close;clear] rat case : Closes the currently open rat case. General IRC Interaction \u00b6 Using EDDI to read the game\u2019s journal, you can send messages to IRC from Elite\u2019s ingame chat. Be aware that the chat message will still appear in the ingame chat channel you send it to! I recommend using local chat and limiting the use to instances that will probably not have other players in it (e.g. instanced in normal space with the client or in SC in some remote system out in the black on a long range rescue). #fuelrats: Use .fr <message> to have VoiceAttack send #<caseNumber> <message> to #fuelrats \u2013 or yell at you when you are not on a case. #ratchat: Use .rc <message> to have VoiceAttack send <message> to #ratchat.

It does everything you need fully from within the game and VoiceAttack, you won\u2019t have to visit the site at any point. Plotting a Route \u00b6 Target the system you want to be routed to (target, do not plot to it). Either exit the galaxy map or make sure you are on its first tab (or auto-plotting will break). Trigger the SpanshAttack.plotRoute command either by voice ( plot neutron [course;route;trip] [with custom range;] ) or by calling it from another command. Enter your ship\u2019s jump range if prompted. Wait for the route to be calculated. The command will automatically open the galaxy map and search it for the first waypoint on your route. Either target the first waypoint or plot to it. Start jumping! Plotting to a System Unknown to the Neutron Router \u00b6 The router can only plot a route to a system that is in its database (obviously can also only give you waypoints that are). If your target system is not, there are several levels of fallback handling to find a system that is. Check Next system coordinates provided by EDDI. If the system is in EDSM, but has for some reason not been sent over EDDN to other sites including Spansh, we can get coordinates here. If the system is not in EDSM check EDTS. It can calculate approximate coordinates for a given procedurally generated system name. If that fails prompt the user for input. Query Spansh\u2019 API for the closest system to these coordinates. Plot a route to the closest system. Generally you should almost never be asked to input coordinates manually. If EDTS provides coordinates with an accuracy that is worse than \u00b1100\u202fly per axis, you will be prompted to make sure you are going roughly to the right coordinates. You will find the system that is used for plotting, its coordinates and the accuracy in VoiceAttack\u2019s log window. Neutron Jumping \u00b6 With standard settings, just supercharge off a neutron cone. You should automatically be taken to the galaxy map with the next waypoint selected. In case you have disabled auto-plotting to the next waypoint, manually invoke the SpanshAttack.targetNextNeutronWaypoint command by voice ( [target;] next neutron [waypoint; way point] ) or calling it from another command. Additionally, you can use the SpanshAttack.copyNextNeutronWaypoint / [get;copy] next neutron [waypoint;way point] command to copy the next neutron waypoint to the clipboard. Skipping a Waypoint \u00b6 Sometimes, especially in very neutron-sparse areas of the galaxy, the plotter will give you weird jumps. E.g. I recently got neutron \u2192 37 ly \u2192 neutron \u2192 440 ly. In these cases you can use the SpanshAttack.skipNeutronWaypoint / skip [this;current] neutron waypoint command to move on to the next one in the list. Manual Re-Plot \u00b6 Trigger the SpanshAttack.replotRoute command either by voice ( replot neutron [course;route;trip] ) or calling it from another command. This will start a re-plot of the current route with the same target system and jump range. Refueling \u00b6 Whenever you finish refueling off a scoopable star, the profile will automatically throttle back up to 100% speed. Unless you have disabled it in your configuration, you will also automatically target the next system on your route and jump to it once you leave fuel scoop range. Clearing a Route \u00b6 When you reach your target system the neutron route will automatically be cleared. If you want to prematurely end your trip, call the SpanshAttack.clearRoute / clear neutron [course;route;trip] command. Other Commands \u00b6 Announcing Jumps Left \u00b6 You can have VoiceAttack tell you the amount of jumps left on the current route by invoking SpanshAttack.announceJumpsLeft or saying how many [neutron;] jumps [are;] left? . Note : Because it\u2019s pretty much impossible to calculate a 100% accurate value for the total jumps left, it will just tell you the jump count from the current neutron waypoint . Announce elapsed time on the trip \u00b6 SpanshAttack keeps track of your start time, even if you have the option to time your trip turned off. This way you can get the time you\u2019ve been jumping with the SpanshAttack.announceTripTime or how long have i been [jumping;on this trip;on this neutron trip]? commands.","title":"SpanshAttack"},{"location":"SpanshAttack/#spanshattack","text":"This profile uses the ED-NeutronRouter plugin to plot neutron jumps using Spansh .

If you are using the standalone version you should probably download the executable installer. If you are using the Steam version of VoiceAttack, you will have to download the zipped folder and replace your installed version with its contents. Here is the first hit on a Google search for finding the installation folder . It is for a completely unrelated game, but the steps are the same. You can potentially also install the latest non-beta version; but I often use features that have only just been added to the beta, so some things might break for you if you are not using that. There might not be a beta version at the time you\u2019re reading this, just get the full release then. Enable Plugin Support \u00b6 Make sure you have plugin support enabled: Go to VoiceAttack settings. Check \u201cenable plugin support\u201d. While you are there, you might also want to enable the automatic update checks (Note: those settings do not exist in the Steam version). Install EDDI \u00b6 Install the latest release from Github (The EDDI-X.Y.Z.exe file under \u201cAssets\u201d). You will need to install it as a VoiceAttack plugin . If you do not want to install it into the VoiceAttack installation folder (or already have it installed somewhere else) you can instead put it elsewhere and create a symbolic link. Open a command prompt (Windows key + R , enter \u201ccmd\u201d, hit Enter ) and do >cd x:\\path\\to\\VoiceAttack\\Apps >mklink /J EDDI x:\\path\\to\\EDDI If you have installed the non-Steam version of VoiceAttack to the default folder within \u201cProgram Files\u201d you will have to run the command prompt as admin (Windows key + R , enter \u201ccmd\u201d, hit Control + Shift + Enter ). Install ED-NeutronRouter \u00b6 Grab the latest release release from Github (The EDNeutronRouter.vX.YZ.zip under \u201cAssets\u201d). You will have to extract the contents of the release .zip file to your VoiceAttack Apps folder: Go into VoiceAttack settings. Click the folder set as \u201cApps Folder\u201d. Now extract the contents of the downloaded file into there. Make sure that they are not naked files under \u201cApps\u201d, but have their own folder \u201cApps\\ED-NeutronRouter\u201d! The exact folder name does not matter as long as they are in a subfolder. Otherwise the plugin will not load. Leave the \u201cApps\u201d folder open in Windows Explorer, you will need it for the next step. Import Profiles Package \u00b6 Acquire the latest release from Github (the alterNERDtive-voiceattack-profiles.vax file under \u201cAssets\u201d). Put it into VoiceAttack\u2019s \u201cImport\u201d folder: Go into VoiceAttack settings. Click the folder set as \u201cApps Folder\u201d. Create a sub folder named \u201cImport\u201d if it does not exist yet. Drop the downloaded .vax file into the \u201cImport\u201d folder. Restart VoiceAttack. When prompted, import the profile package. VoiceAttack will restart when completed. Create a Custom Profile \u00b6 Last but not least you are going to create your own custom VoiceAttack profile for Elite. It will allow you to add your own commands, override any commands in the profiles that you want to change and add voice triggers or hotkeys. You can either use an existing profile, create a new one or use the provided profile example as a basis. Regardless of which way you choose, make sure to read the Include Profiles section and follow the instructions there! Option 1: Create a New Profile Or Use an Existing One \u00b6 Click the \u201cProfile Actions\u201d button, then \u201cCreate New Profile\u201d. Give it a name and add some commands if you want to. Hit \u201cDone\u201d to create the new profile. Alternatively you can keep using your existing profile. You will still have to follow the rest of the instructions in this case. Create a Startup Command \u00b6 First off, hit the \u201cEdit\u201d button in VoiceAttack. If you are using your existing profile (or have just created a fresh one) you will now have to create the startup command. Hit the \u201cNew Command\u201d button. You can name it anything you want but I recommend calling it \u201cstartup\u201d or similar, and to deactivate the \u201cwhen I say\u201d checkbox in the command options to make sure you do not accidentally run it via voice. Add a new action using \u201cOther\u201d \u2192 \u201cVoiceAttack Action\u201d\u2192 \u201cExecute Another Command\u201d. Choose \u201cExecute by name (Advanced)\u201d and enter ((alterNERDtive-base.startup)) . Make sure to leave \u201cWait until this command completes before continuing\u201d on and have this action at the top of the action list for the command. That way you can be sure that my profiles are initialized properly before your personal startup actions are processed. You can add anything else you want your profile to do when it loads below this action. You do not have to set any configuration options, this can be done way more elegantly! More on this later on . After adding the startup command you will have to right click VoiceAttack\u2019s title bar and choose \u201cReload Active Profile\u201d or restart VoiceAttack to see it executed for the first time. Option 2: Use the Profile Example \u00b6 Click the \u201cProfile Actions\u201d button, then \u201cImport Profile\u201d. Navigate to your VoiceAttack Apps folder (see above), go into the \u201calterNERDtive\u201d subfolder, choose the profile example and hit \u201cOpen\u201d. Once you are done with the setup and configuration process, you can find a bunch of example commands with comments on how to do things in this profile. Make sure to also rename it to something more exciting than \u201cCustom Profile Example\u201d! Include Profiles \u00b6 In order to use my profiles with your custom profile, you will need to take two additional steps: Include the profiles in your custom profile. That will make all commands available when your custom profile is active. Create a startup command for your custom profile. You can use it to do anything you want when your profile loads, but it will also have to run the startup command for my profiles. Set Profile Options \u00b6 While editing the profile, hit the \u201cOptions\u201d button. On the section labeled \u201cInclude commands from other profiles\u201d, hit the \u201c\u2026\u201d button. Add all my profiles (\u201calterNERDtive-base\u201d, \u201cEliteAttack\u201d, \u201cRatAttack\u201d, \u201cSpanshAttack\u201d, \u201cStreamAttack\u201d). Make sure that \u201calterNERDtive-base\u201d is on top of the list, the order of the others does not matter. But I like it nice and alphabetical. Technically you can leave out any profile you are not planning to use. Practically it probably will not hurt you to just include everything, and it will then be available for you in the future should you choose to check it out! Now switch to the \u201cProfile Exec\u201d tab. Tick the \u201cExecute a command each time this profile is loaded\u201d checkbox, and select the \u201cstartup\u201d command you have created earlier. Reload the Profile \u00b6 To make sure everything is loaded correctly, you now need to either reload the profile by right clicking on VoiceAttack\u2019s title bar \u2192 \u201cReset Active Profile\u201d or by simply restarting VoiceAttack. You should see a bunch of initialization messages pop up in the VoiceAttack log. Set Elite Keyboard Binds \u00b6 You need to have keyboard binds setup at least as secondary bindings in Elite\u2019s controls options. VoiceAttack cannot \u201cpush\u201d joystick buttons for you, it can only do keyboard inputs. Hence its only way to interact with Elite is through keyboard emulation, even if you otherwise play the game with a controller or HOTAS. Or racing wheel. Or Rock Band set. Or bananas. For the \u201cGalaxy Map\u201d section, make sure that the bindings do not conflict with the ones in the \u201cInterface Mode\u201d section. The map bindings take precedence and a conflict leads to VoiceAttack being unable to target systems for you. In that case you would see it open the map for you and then wiggle the view for a split second instead of switching tabs over to the system search. Should you use a keyboard layout that is not en-US QWERTY, some keys might not work out of the box. You can try telling bindED about your keyboard layout by setting the bindED.layout# variable (including the # !) to something more appropriate in your startup command. Currently bindED supports the en-US , en-GB and de-Neo2 layouts.

You will need the full version, available for $10 (official site) or \u20ac11.99 (Steam, IIRC $14.99 for our US-based friends). I recommend buying on the site. Why? Because on Steam, Valve gets a 30% cut. Unlike many other developers Gary (the developer of VoiceAttack) remedies that by having a price on Steam that ends up paying $10 to him.

If your microphone is bad and you still get erroneous recognitions when you are not speaking it is probably going to recognize the same command every time. You can remedy that by blocking the voice trigger. One-syllable triggers are especially prone to misrecognition. Create a new command in your custom profile.

For example you cannot tell HCS to run an included profile\u2019s startup command.

Instead you will have to create a custom profile, and the new \u201cbase\u201d profile that the others require to be included in your custom profile is \u201calterNERDtive-base\u201d. That way you can use e.g. RatAttack without having to also use the general Elite profile. To be consistent with the other profiles it has been renamed to \u201cEliteAttack\u201d. If you are upgrading from an older version the name will not change for you in the profiles list. I recommend renaming your \u201cEliteDangerous\u201d profile to \u201cEliteAttack\u201d to prevent confusion in the future, but it is not strictly necessary to do so. RatAttack \u00b6 Getting Case Data From IRC \u00b6 Handing a RATSIGNAL from IRC to VoiceAttack via text file is now deprecated and the feature will be removed in a future version. Instead you should use the new RatAttack-cli.exe helper tool that uses IPC to talk to the VoiceAttack plugin. For that you have to change the way your IRC client handles incoming case announcements. Instead of writing the announcement to the text file and calling VoiceAttack to run a command, it will have to call the helper tool with a) the announcement and b) an optional true/false switch to determine if the case should be announced via TTS or just added to the case list. For my AdiIRC, it looks like this (obviously change the path, please): on *:TEXT:*RATSIGNAL*(??_SIGNAL):#fuelrats:{ if ( $away ) { /run -h \"X:\\path\\to\\VoiceAttack\\Apps\\alterNERDtive\\RatAttack-cli.exe\" \" $+ $replace($1-,\",\"\") $+ \" false } else { /run -h \"X:\\path\\to\\VoiceAttack\\Apps\\alterNERDtive\\RatAttack-cli.exe\" \" $+ $replace($1-,\",\"\") $+ \" true } } If I am away it will just add the new case to the list.

Once you switch back, the correct settings for the profile are re-loaded.","title":"Settings"},{"location":"configuration/general/#general-settings-for-all-profiles","text":"Toggles: auto update check : Automatically check Github for profiles updates when the profile loads.
