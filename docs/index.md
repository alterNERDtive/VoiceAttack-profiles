# Elite Dangerous VoiceAttack Profiles

These are various profiles for [VoiceAttack](https://voiceattack.com) (VA) I use 
to enhance my Elite experience. They give me important info, facilitate 
day-to-day gaming and do some special things for [Fuel 
Rats](https://fuelrats.com) and [Hull Seals](https://hullseals.space) work.

**NOTE**: Further development is on hold and Odyssey compatibility will not be
worked on for the time being. See [the corresponding issue on
Github](https://github.com/alterNERDtive/VoiceAttack-profiles/issues/113). This
might or might not change after the Horizons/Odyssey merge. Feel free to file
issues for anything that is broken on Odyssey and it will be worked on when it
is worked on.

## Available Profiles

* [EliteAttack](EliteAttack): The main Elite VA profile. Anything related to
  “just” playing the game.
* [RatAttack](RatAttack): Manages interactions with the FuelRats IRC server.
* [SpanshAttack](SpanshAttack): Plots and follows trips along the neutron
  highway using [Spansh’s neutron plotter](https://spansh.co.uk/plotter).
* [StreamAttack](StreamAttack): Writes various status things to files that can
  then be read by streaming software like OBS.

They all require the `alterNERDtive-base` profile that, well, provides basic
functionality common to all of the above.
