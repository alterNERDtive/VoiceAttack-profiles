# Installing

## Install VoiceAttack

Grab the [most recent VoiceAttack beta
version](https://voiceattack.com/#download-1) off the official site and install
it.

If you are using the standalone version you should probably download the
executable installer.

![[VoiceAttack-download.png]]

If you are using the Steam version of VoiceAttack, you will have to download the
zipped folder and replace your installed version with its contents.

[Here is the first hit on a Google search for finding the installation
folder](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=760447682). It is
for a completely unrelated game, but the steps are the same.

You can potentially also install the latest non-beta version; but I often use
features that have only just been added to the beta, so some things might break
for you if you are not using that. There might not be a beta version at the time
you’re reading this, just get the full release then.

### Enable Plugin Support

Make sure you have plugin support enabled:

1. Go to VoiceAttack settings. ![[VoiceAttack-settings.png]]
1. Check “enable plugin support”. ![[VoiceAttack-settings-plugin-support.png]]

While you are there, you might also want to enable the automatic update checks
(Note: those settings do not exist in the Steam version).

## Install EDDI

Install [the latest release](https://github.com/EDCD/EDDI/releases/latest) from
Github (The `EDDI-X.Y.Z.exe` file under “Assets”). You will need to [install it 
as a VoiceAttack
plugin](https://github.com/EDCD/EDDI/wiki/VoiceAttack-Integration#using-eddi-with-voiceattack).

If you do not want to install it into the VoiceAttack installation folder (or
already have it installed somewhere else) you can instead put it elsewhere and
create a symbolic link. Open a command prompt (Windows key + `R`, enter “cmd”,
hit `Enter`) and do

```cmd
>cd x:\path\to\VoiceAttack\Apps
>mklink /J EDDI x:\path\to\EDDI
```

If you have installed the non-Steam version of VoiceAttack to the default folder
within “Program Files” you will have to run the command prompt as admin (Windows
key + `R`, enter “cmd”, hit `Control` + `Shift` + `Enter`).

## Install ED-NeutronRouter

Grab [the latest release release from 
Github](https://github.com/sc-pulgan/ED-NeutronRouter/releases/latest) (The 
`EDNeutronRouter.vX.YZ.zip` under “Assets”). You will have to extract the 
contents of the release .zip file to your VoiceAttack Apps folder:

1. Go into VoiceAttack settings. ![[VoiceAttack-settings.png]]
1. Click the folder set as “Apps Folder”. ![[VoiceAttack-apps.png]]

Now extract the contents of the downloaded file into there. Make sure that they
are not naked files under “Apps”, but have their own folder
“Apps\ED-NeutronRouter”! The exact folder name does not matter as long as they
_are_ in a subfolder. Otherwise the plugin will not load.

![[ED-NeutronRouter-folder.png]]

Leave the “Apps” folder open in Windows Explorer, you will need it for the next step.

## Import Profiles Package

Acquire [the latest
release](https://github.com/alterNERDtive/VoiceAttack-profiles/releases/latest)
from Github (the `alterNERDtive-voiceattack-profiles.vax` file under “Assets”).
Put it into VoiceAttack’s “Import” folder:

1. Go into VoiceAttack settings. ![[VoiceAttack-settings.png]]
1. Click the folder set as “Apps Folder”. ![[VoiceAttack-apps.png]]
1. Create a sub folder named “Import” if it does not exist yet.
1. Drop the downloaded .vax file into the “Import” folder.
1. Restart VoiceAttack.
1. When prompted, import the profile package. VoiceAttack will restart when completed.

## Create a Custom Profile

Last but not least you are going to create your own custom VoiceAttack profile
for Elite. It will allow you to add your own commands, override any commands in
the profiles that you want to change and add voice triggers or hotkeys.

You can either use an existing profile, create a new one or use the provided
profile example as a basis. Regardless of which way you choose, make sure to
read the [Include Profiles](#include-profiles) section and follow the instructions there!

### Option 1: Create a New Profile Or Use an Existing One

1. Click the “Profile Actions” button, then “Create New Profile”.
   ![[VoiceAttack-new-profile.png]]
1. Give it a name and add some commands if you want to.
1. Hit “Done” to create the new profile.

Alternatively you can keep using your existing profile. You will still have to
follow the rest of the instructions in this case.

#### Create a Startup Command

First off, hit the “Edit” button in VoiceAttack.

![[VoiceAttack-edit.png]]

If you are using your existing profile (or have just created a fresh one) you
will now have to create the startup command. Hit the “New Command” button.

![[VoiceAttack-edit-new-command.png]]

You can name it anything you want but I recommend calling it “startup” or
similar, and to deactivate the “when I say” checkbox in the command options to
make sure you do not accidentally run it via voice.

![[VoiceAttack-edit-startup.png]]

Add a new action using “Other” → “VoiceAttack Action”→ “Execute Another Command”.

![[VoiceAttack-edit-startup-execute.png]]

Choose “Execute by name (Advanced)” and enter `((alterNERDtive-base.startup))`.

![[VoiceAttack-edit-startup-action.png]]

Make sure to leave “Wait until this command completes before continuing” on and
have this action at the top of the action list for the command. That way you can
be sure that my profiles are initialized properly before your personal startup
actions are processed.

![[VoiceAttack-edit-startup-actionlist.png]]

You can add anything else you want your profile to do when it loads below this
action. You do not have to set any configuration options, this can be done way
more elegantly! More on this [later on](general.md#settings).

After adding the startup command you will have to right click VoiceAttack’s
title bar and choose “Reload Active Profile” or restart VoiceAttack to see it
executed for the first time.

### Option 2: Use the Profile Example

1. Click the “Profile Actions” button, then “Import Profile”.
   ![[VoiceAttack-import-profile.png]]
1. Navigate to your VoiceAttack Apps folder (see above), go into the
   “alterNERDtive” subfolder, choose the profile example and hit “Open”.
   ![[VoiceAttack-import-profile-open.png]]

Once you are done with the setup and configuration process, you can find a bunch
of example commands with comments on how to do things in this profile. Make sure
to also rename it to something more exciting than “Custom Profile Example”!

## Include Profiles

In order to use my profiles with your custom profile, you will need to take two
additional steps:

1. Include the profiles in your custom profile. That will make all commands
   available when your custom profile is active.
1. Create a startup command for your custom profile. You can use it to do
   anything you want when your profile loads, but it will also have to run the
   startup command for my profiles.

#### Set Profile Options

While editing the profile, hit the “Options” button.

![[VoiceAttack-profile-options.png]]

On the section labeled “Include commands from other profiles”, hit the “…”
button.

![[VoiceAttack-profile-options-include.png]]

Add all my profiles (“alterNERDtive-base”, “EliteAttack”, “RatAttack”,
“SpanshAttack”, “StreamAttack”).

![[VoiceAttack-profile-options-includelist.png]]

Make sure that “alterNERDtive-base” is on top of the list, the order of the
others does not matter. But I like it nice and alphabetical. Technically you can
leave out any profile you are not planning to use. Practically it probably will
not hurt you to just include everything, and it will then be available for you
in the future should you choose to check it out!

Now switch to the “Profile Exec” tab. Tick the “Execute a command each time this
profile is loaded” checkbox, and select the “startup” command you have created
earlier.

![[VoiceAttack-profile-options-startup.png]]

## Set Elite Keyboard Binds

You need to have keyboard binds setup at least as secondary bindings in Elite’s
controls options. VoiceAttack _cannot_ “push” joystick buttons for you, it can
only do keyboard inputs. Hence its only way to interact with Elite is through
keyboard emulation, even if you otherwise play the game with a controller or
HOTAS. Or racing wheel. Or Rock Band set. Or bananas.

![[Elite-binds.png]]

For the “Galaxy Map” section, make sure that the bindings do not conflict with
the ones in the “Interface Mode” section. The map bindings take precedence and a
conflict leads to VoiceAttack being unable to target systems for you. In that
case you would see it open the map for you and then wiggle the view for a split
second instead of switching tabs over to the system search.

![[Elite-binds-galmap.png]]

Should you use a keyboard layout that is _not_ en-US QWERTY, some keys might not
work out of the box. You can try telling bindED about your keyboard layout by
setting the `bindED.layout#` variable (including the `#`!) to something more
appropriate in your startup command.

![[bindED-layout.png]]

Currently bindED supports the `en-US`, `en-GB` and `de-Neo2` layouts. [You can
find instructions on how to add your own 
here](https://alternerdtive.github.io/bindED/troubleshooting/#adding-a-keyboard-layout).
